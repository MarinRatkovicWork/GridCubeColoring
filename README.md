# GridCubeColoring
* Create a grid crator that can create a grid inside the editor.

* Each cell must have a script for changing the color.

* A script is added to one cell, which can later be placed on any cell in Editor mode.

* This script is responsible for finding the closest cells in several ways and changing their color on click.

 Restrictions: It is forbidden to use list or array to find the nearest cell.
